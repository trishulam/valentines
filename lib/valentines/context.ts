Vamsi and Vanya met at IIT Madras. From the first moment he looked into her eyes, he knew there was something divine there — a spark that didn't just light him up, but made him become himself.

June 9th — Malaviya Hall, IITM. Her head on his shoulder, hands locked, love songs softly echoing from the projector, the whole world asleep around them. That was the night she told him she loved him. He already did; he just hadn't whispered it yet. That night was their beginning. Their Janmashtami. When Radha and Krishna found each other again — disguised as Vanya and Vamsi.

Their first date was the magical ECR ride — not just for the thrill of being together, but for what he saw in her eyes: genuineness, trust, a quiet promise that said "I want this. I want us. All of it, forever."

She broke through walls he swore no one would ever cross. She made him fall back in love with love.

LETTER 1 — To My Pondati:
From the first moment I looked into your eyes — I knew. There was something divine there. A spark that didn't just light me up, but made me become myself.
Since then, every second with you — each laugh, whisper, cuddle, and tear — has led me deeper into that realization: You were written for me. By something higher.
Babloo... baby... pondati... pappu buvva... kutty... I call you a hundred things, but they all mean one truth: You are mine. And I am better because of you.
You're infectious joy wrapped in sweet drama. Strength, in your softness. Chaos, with the kindest smile. And somehow, everything I've ever called home.
I'll always go back to that night in Malaviya Hall, IITM — your head on my shoulder, hands locked, love songs softly echoing from the projector, and the whole world asleep around us. That was the night you told me you loved me. I already did. I just hadn't whispered it yet.
That night was our beginning. June 9th. Our Janmashtami. When Radha and Krishna found each other again — disguised as Vanya and Vamsi.
Our first date — the magical ECR ride — is printed in my memory. Not just for the thrill of being together, but for what I saw in your eyes: genuineness. Trust. A quiet promise that said, "I want this. I want us. All of it, forever."
You broke through walls I swore no one would ever cross. You made me fall back in love with love.
When you cry, I feel your soul trembling in mine. And on nights you're not okay — I'm not either.
Pondati — this isn't just love. It's destined. Fated. Sacred.
I LOVE YOU. In ways this world can't measure. In ways I'll never stop.
You empower me, Babloo. To build. To lead. To dream.
I keep replaying scenes of our story: You doing makeup on my face… Our eyes meeting in dance practice… That unforgettable DJ Night dancing together… The way you fed me in front of everyone, and I felt like I was ruling the world inside. That sleepy ride where you dozed off on my shoulder... Our fake relationship roleplays that became real, sacred love.
You gave me your heart. And I built a home with it. Right inside mine.
Vrindha tugging your pallu, crying for rasmalai and mangoes — just like her mom. Rudra, covered in paint, wild and unstoppable like his dad. Us dancing in the kitchen, roses on the table. Holding each other tight on a 40th floor balcony somewhere in LA, Dubai, or New York.
Mrs. Vanya Tentiwala. Wife of Vamsi Krishna. Not because tradition demands—but because love chose.
Until stars forget to shine, Until time chooses to rest, Until the final page of our story is written... I will love you — madly, unshakably, eternally.
Your Purusha, Your Krishna, Forever & Only Yours, Vamsi

LETTER 2 — Chennai & Coorg:
My dear pondati. My babloo. My Radha. My Devi.
This trip felt like something our souls already knew. Chennai and Coorg did not feel like travel. They felt like memories we already lived.
When we walked into the temples, especially Kapaleeshwar, my heart felt peaceful. I remembered Janmabhoomi, standing before Radha and Krishna, feeling blessed that you were mine. We entered this new year as One — Emotionally. Physically, Spiritually. Mentally.
On the trek, I understood love a little more. My heart wanted to protect you from everything. But love also means trusting your strength. When we climbed again and reached the top, I was proud because you listened to your own voice. I saw courage in you and I loved you even more for it.
Taking you to the ocean and the port felt like opening a part of my soul. It is legacy to me. It is my dream. Standing there with you, I felt calm. I felt protected. I felt like we can face anything together.
Seeing you in my home, talking to my mother, sitting so naturally in my world, felt like peace.
Waking up next to you, just holding hands, felt like love that does not need to prove anything.
I am proud of the woman you are becoming. Choosing dharma. Choosing growth.
This trip was not just a trip. It was closeness. It was healing. It was God softly reminding us that what we share is real, divine and guided.
Wherever life takes us, I will be there. Not ahead. Not above. But beside you. Loving you. Holding you. Being yours. Always your Krishna. Always your Purusha. Always your Vamsi.
Forever and only yours.
